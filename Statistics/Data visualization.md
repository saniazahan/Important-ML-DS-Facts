## Violin plot [link](https://chartio.com/learn/charts/violin-plot-complete-guide/)
A violin plot depicts distributions of numeric data for one or more groups using density curves. The width of each curve corresponds with the approximate frequency of data points in each region. Densities are frequently accompanied by an overlaid chart type, such as box plot, to provide additional information.

The example violin plot above depicts the results of a fictional experiment with one control group and two experimental conditions. In the middle of each density curve is a small box plot, with the rectangle showing the ends of the first and third quartiles and central dot the median. We can see from the plot that the two experimental techniques provided different benefits compared to the control. However, the second experimental condition (B) has a much more elongated distribution compared to the other two groups, without a distinct peak.
