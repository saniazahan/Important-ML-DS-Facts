## What is API
APIs (Application Programming Interface) are sets of definitions and protocols that allow software components to talk and interact with each other using a simple set of commands. Acting as messengers, APIs deliver one applicationâ€™s request to another and return a response in real time.

APIs are used to make requests to a server and return response to the application, either with the required data or an error message. However, the server needs to handle situations like too many requests at a time. 

## API key
An API key is an unique identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is used to either grant or deny access to service based on clinet's access permission and track numnber of request made.
